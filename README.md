## Game Functionality

The Game has 8 pairs of randomly arranged cards with face down initially. When a user clicks any one the cards, game starts, timer begins and
the symbol underneath the card is revealed. When the next card is clicked, the symbol of that card is revealed and if both the symbols match,
 the cards stay opened else they are flipped back. The game finishes when all the cards are matched and user rating, time taken and number of
 moves is displayed.

### Star Rating

The star rating is based on number of moves user takes to complete the Game:

* 3 stars if the number of moves is less than 18.
* 2 stars if the number of moves is between 17 and 24.
* 1 star if the number of moves is more than 23.
